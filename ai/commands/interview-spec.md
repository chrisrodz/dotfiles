Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious, be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete and no more questions arise. Capture the interview results in a new file.
